The typical price of a starter home in the Denver metro has gone up by more than 2.5 times from 2012 to 2021. The typical price of a starter home in the Denver metro has gone up by more than 2.5 times from 2012 to 2021 and has nearly tripled from 2012 to October 2022. That is according to a 9Wants to Know analysis of median home sale data in the Entry-Level Sale Price (5th-10th percentile) from Zillow. Data was provided monthly and a median was taken of those figures. Please see attached. 

Sticking with 2012 to 2021 growth is the safest bet. The precise amount of growth could change once the data from the last three months of 2022 comes in.
